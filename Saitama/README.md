# Anime Character Drawing: Saitama from One Punch Man

## Overview

This project is a CodePen challenge where the goal was to recreate a favorite anime character using HTML and CSS. I chose **Saitama** from the anime *One Punch Man*. The character is famous for his bald head.

## Features

- A **bald head** with a smooth, round shape.
- A **simple facial structure**, including eyebrows, eyes, a nose, and a mouth.

The design uses various CSS techniques, such as border-radius, positioning, and z-index, to create the character's distinctive look. The design is fully responsive and centered on the page.

## Instructions

1. **Clone or View the Pen**: You can view this project directly on [CodePen](#) or clone it to your own account to make any changes or improvements.
   
2. **HTML**: The HTML code provides a basic structure for the character, using `<div>` elements for each facial feature.
   
3. **CSS**: The CSS file contains the styles for the shapes, including the skin tone, the layout of the face, the position of the eyes, and the overall appearance of Saitama's head.
